                  The CAPSA provides quality and personalized one-on-one tutoring service to K-12 students 
                  during the MCPS academic school year. Offered in person, these tutoring sessions are held 
                  once per week and cover various subject areas to address the educational and personal needs 
                  of the students. Our tutors and program leaders are trained student volunteers who are eager 
                  to help other students and give back to the community.

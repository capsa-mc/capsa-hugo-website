## The Debut of the New CAPSA Website

We are proud to announce the launch of the brand new CAPSA website! Brought to you by the administrative associates team, the website aims to deliver all the information and resources of CAPSA to both our members and newcomers with a sleek, more modern look. The previous CAPSA website will still be available, which you can access through the button at the top entitled "Legacy Website."

## Coordinators Wanted!

Calling all experienced CAPSA volunteers! We're looking for tutors to serve as coordinators for the upcoming school year. Those who are interested should fill out the coordinator application form in the Resource section of the site. 

Thank you all for reading this first news post! Stay tuned for future updates!
